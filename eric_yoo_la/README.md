Standardized Testing Participation Exploration

The SAT has been seeing a decline in participation rates for the past decade. 

Looking at the dataset provided, the data is sufficient to rejet the null hypothesis, but the confidence intervals and the plotted visuals indicate that the distribution is skewed and not normalized; the sample size is likely too small to effectively come to conclusions. The scatterplot does show that the partiicpation is polarized in most states, where many students take only one test or the other. Mapping the participation rates by state would show some patterns in regionality. Another observation would be the possible relation between the participation rate and testing averages - however, this can be explained by a biased sample; the individuals in states that prioritize one test that take the other would likely be the ones trying to maximize their chances of acceptance.

The notebook primarily utilizes Pandas to manipulate dataframes, along with MatPlotLib to visualize.
